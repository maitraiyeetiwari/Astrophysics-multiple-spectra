# Astrophysics-multiple-spectra

I plotted spectra towards different regions of a luminous star forming region named RCW49.

# Code and resources
To make this plot, I used an astronomical software named GILDAS, which is popular in the astronomical community for analysing data. 

# Observation files
CII, CO, OI observation files were all regrided to the same angular resolution. 

# Method
Baseline subtractions were done for every spectrum before plotting.
